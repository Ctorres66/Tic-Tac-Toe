# Tic-Tac-Toe
Repository where the main goal is to reproduce the game Tic-Tac-Toe with Java Programming. 

In this repository, i will be using what i learned from the checkers project (mainly JButtons) to attempt to reproduce a game of tic-tac-toe in Java. Since, by what i see, this is alot simpler to make than checkers, i hope that this project will be complete in less time than checkers. Then again, since a new semester of class is just starting, the amount of time i spend coding between each update could be diminished. Either way, i feel like this would be a good way to review and apply once more what i learned during the checkers project.
